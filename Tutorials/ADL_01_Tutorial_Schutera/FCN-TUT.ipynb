    "\n",
    "Backpropagation is the central part of iterative optimization. The backpropagation utilizes the derivative of each unit in the neural network starting with the determined error resulting from the loss function. With the chain rule the various units are connected to obtain the derivatives of the loss function through all layers. The resulting matrix shows you how each weight effects the output and its error. Thus, aiming to minimize the error the derivatives tell you in which direction to update the associated weights.\n",
