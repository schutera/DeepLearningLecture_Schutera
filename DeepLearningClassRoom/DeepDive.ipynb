This is how the idea of artificial neural networks came into being. <br>\n",

    "Your brain is made up of approximately 80 billion neurons, or brain cells, which are heavily interconnected with what are called synapses. Neurons communicate with each other by sending electrical impulses through these synapses. If a neuron receives enough of these messages, the neuron itself sends an impulse to the neurons it is connected with. In this way the brain is able to process complex data, extract features and recognize pattern. <br>\n",

For the purpose of explainability we further reduce our neural network to a single neuron with two inputs $x_0$ and $x_1$, that travel along synapses with connection factors $w_0$ and $w_1$. The neuron then sends an output $y$ with respect to the activation function $f($**x**$, $**W**$)$. <br>\n",

To put things into perspective humans come in second with ($8.6\\times10^{10}$) neurons, only surpassed by the african elephant.

    "Usually visualizations to build your intuition are most beneficial during your first training runs on problems you do not know what to expect from your neural network. In visualizations you might also be able to pick up wrong label assignments (think somebody labeled all \"8\"s as \"9\"s), ambiguous or overlapping classes (think somebody labeled all \"6\"s and \"9\"s as the same class). These things do not usually happen in beautifully, cleaned datasets such as MNIST. But I promise you, you will be surprised how messy these public datasets out there are. And further I promise you, that if you are building your own datasets these bugs will be there too and want to be found.\n",

To make things clearer, numbers in the diagonal are true positives, meaning Marvin predicted them correct. "

You will learn about Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more. You will work on case studies from healthcare, autonomous driving, sign language reading, music generation, and natural language processing. You will master not only the theory, but also see how it is applied in industry. You will practice all these ideas in Python and in TensorFlow, which we will teach.\n",

    "[From beginning to mastery](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition - Andrej Karpathy Abstract: Computer Vision has become ubiquitous in our society, with applications in search, image understanding, apps, mapping, medicine, drones, and self-driving cars. Core to many of these applications are visual recognition tasks such as image classification, localization and detection. Recent developments in neural network (aka “deep learning”) approaches have greatly advanced the performance of these state-of-the-art visual recognition systems. This course is a deep dive into details of the deep learning architectures with a focus on learning end-to-end models for these tasks, particularly image classification. During the 10-week course, students will learn to implement, train and debug their own neural networks and gain a detailed understanding of cutting-edge research in computer vision. The final assignment will involve training a multi-million parameter convolutional neural network and applying it on the largest image classification dataset (ImageNet). We will focus on teaching how to set up the problem of image recognition, the learning algorithms (e.g. backpropagation), practical engineering tricks for training and fine-tuning the networks and guide the students through hands-on assignments and a final course project. Much of the background and materials of this course will be drawn from the ImageNet Challenge. There is also a YouTube [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfnWJUyUJYU&list=PLkt2uSq6rBVctENoVBg1TpCC7OQi31AlC). \n",
